To test your application over HTTPS locally, you will need to create a self-signed SSL certificate and modify your server to use HTTPS. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Generate a self-signed SSL certificate. You can use OpenSSL to do this. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
openssl genrsa -out localhost.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key localhost.key -out localhost.cert -days 365 -subj /CN=localhost
This will create a private key file (localhost.key) and a certificate file (localhost.cert).

Modify your server to use HTTPS. You will need to import the https module, read the key and certificate files, and create an HTTPS server. Here's an example:
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = require('express')();

// Your existing routes...

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('localhost.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('localhost.cert')
};

Update your session middleware to set secure to true:
router.use(session({
    secret: generateSecret(),
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: { secure: true, httpOnly: true, name: "c"}, // Note: secure is now set to true
    store: sessionStore
}));
Now you can start your server and access your application over HTTPS at https://localhost:3000. Note that because you're using a self-signed certificate, your browser will warn you that the connection is not secure. You can safely ignore this warning when testing locally.
Remember to replace 3000 with the actual port your server is listening on.
