**Are they frameworks?**

Yes, the design libraries mentioned above can be considered frameworks in the sense that they provide a set of pre-built components, styles, and tools for building user interfaces. They offer a consistent and standardized approach to UI development, making it easier and faster to create visually appealing and functional web pages.

**Which is better for building a pretty web page?**

The "best" design library for building a pretty web page depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here's a brief comparison of the libraries mentioned earlier:

**Material UI:**

* Pros: Comprehensive component library, follows Material Design guidelines, user-friendly experience.
* Cons: Can be complex for beginners, large bundle size.

**Ant Design:**

* Pros: Clean and modern aesthetics, rich set of components, enterprise-level design principles.
* Cons: May not be as customizable as other libraries.

**Chakra UI:**

* Pros: Accessibility focus, modularity, easy to use and customize.
* Cons: Relatively new, may have a smaller community compared to other libraries.

**Styled Components:**

* Pros: Concise and maintainable styling, high level of customization.
* Cons: Requires more knowledge of CSS and JavaScript.

**Emotion:**

* Pros: Performance, small bundle size, theming support.
* Cons: Similar learning curve to Styled Components.

**Other factors to consider:**

* **Size and complexity of your application:** If you're building a large and complex application, you may prefer a library like Material UI or Ant Design that offers a wide range of components and features.
* **Styling approach:** If you prefer to style your components directly in your JavaScript code, CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components or Emotion may be a better choice.
* **Customization:** If you need a high level of customization and flexibility, libraries like Chakra UI or Styled Components may be more suitable.

Ultimately, the best way to choose a design library is to experiment with different options and see which one best fits your workflow and project requirements.
